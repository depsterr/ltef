# docs

This is my "gymnasiearbete", a larger project for school. As such I will document my process here.

In this work I will attempt to answer the following questions:

* How does the x86_64 processor architecture handle executable loading.

* What operations must a linker run in order to convert object files into an executable file.

* What features are needed to create a linker capable of linking a kernel
