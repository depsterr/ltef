This is my "gymnasiearbete", a larger project for school. As such I will document my process here.

Though I live in Sweden I've chosen to document my work in English for two reasons:

1. A lot of the terminology surrounding computing don't have any Swedish equivalents.

2. This is also a public GitHub repository, and this report might end up being a useful resource for another, future, programmer.

The actual report is in [report.md](report.md)

The rough planning for the project is available in [planning.md](planning.md)
