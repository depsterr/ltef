This is my "gymnasiearbete", a larger project for school. As such I will document my process here.

Though I live in Sweden I've chosen to document my work in English for two reasons:

1. A lot of the terminology surrounding computing don't have any Swedish equivalents.

2. This is also a public GitHub repository, and this report might end up being a useful resource for another, future, programmer.

Questions
---------

In this work I will attempt to answer the following questions:

1. How do x86_64 processors load executables?

2. What operations must a linker run in order to convert object files into an executable file?

3. What features are needed to create a linker capable of linking a kernel?
