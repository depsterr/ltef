## Introduction

### Background

An operating systems core, the kernel is made up of many different object files which must be linked by a linker. However existing linkers are large, arguably over engineered, programs which makes it hard to port them to new operating systems. This makes it much harder to achieve a self hosting operating system.

In order to limit the scope of this project I've chosen to only target the x86_64 processor architecture as well as only supporting the ELF format for relocatable and executable files.

### Purpose

### Feature Specification (kravspec)

### Required knowledge

Talk about the object, executable model as well as the ELF file format.
